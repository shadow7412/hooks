DR HOOK.

This is a git repo that is meant to reside inside in the .git folder.

The idea of this code is to test all files for syntax errors before allowing them into the repository.

It only tests new files - so runs quickly.

It uses a case statement to distinguish different languages - this means that many languages can be added in the future.

WARNING - this tests files in the working directory. That could cause problems if you are doing partial commits etc.
